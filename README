#Welcome to the git repository for my site!

##About the site

I'm trying to keep things pretty simple as far as the web site goes. I know how easy it would be to pull in bootstrap and give my website an instant facelift. I want to avoid this because I don't think it will add value.

I want to keep the website relatively bare bones as well. I'm using Flask right now, and I considered serving things purely as html. I decided to use Jinja2 templates because support is built into Flask and it removes a bit of code duplication. Still, I want to keep the website as platform agnostic as possible, with an emphasis on content over using the latest and greatest in the world of web dev.

Work on this website began in earnest on January 3rd 2016.

Please send any comments, ideas, or suggestions to me on GitHub. I promise I'll take anything sent to me into consideration, even design ideas. I don't want my site to be a complete eyesore.
